<h1>Web Site Critiques</h1>
<h2>https://www.utah.com/nationalparks/</h2>
<ol>
	<li>What was your first impression of this site?
			<p>The site is well organized and eye catching. The navigation is easy to follow.</p></li>
	<li>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)
		<p>The site uses a top navigation and a footer navigation. The top navigation are just links and the navigation in the footer is more spread and listed in columns.</p></li>
	<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?
		<p>The site has been restructured or rebuilt in the last little while. The index page has a note as such, that confuses me because the rest of the site is put together and
			structured.</p></li>
	<li>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?
		<p>The main graphic tells you that the site is about Southern Utah and being active. There isn't really anything else that keeps your interest
			in staying at the site</p></li>
	<li>How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?
		<p>The page loaded fairly quickly. There is nothing on the site that would slow it down. The header is a javascript. The only large image on the site
			is the header image</p></li>
	<li>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?
		<p>The sie and the color for the text is ok. I wold have probably used a different font. A couple of the letters in the menus look like run together.
			There is an elongated tail on the & in Tours & Guides. Making it look like I had a spot on my computer screen.</p></li>
	<li>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?
		<p>The site uses a top navigation bar in the header that is repeated throughout the site. Making it look like a template has been used.</p></li>
	<li>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?
		<p>The site appears to be using earthy tones, with brown, grey and white being used through out the site.</p></li>
	<li>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?
		<p>The site resizes very well. The header image is still viewable and detectable with a smaller window. 
			The top navigation switches to a hamburger style menu with the smaller window</p></li>
	<li>What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?
		<p>I usually like to have navigation on the top and bottom of the web page. In this case, having the javascript in the header and then the 
			full menu displayed at the bottom of the page seems a little over kill.</p></li>
